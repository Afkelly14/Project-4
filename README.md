    HTML: list of questions, set of questions is a form
    JAVASCRIPT: correct answers add to the score, submit button will automatically show score, timeout function at onload to automatically submit the quiz if timer runs out
    CSS: colorful game page


    option functions:
    event listeners: onclick, on last button click - show score, have image pop up
    end game function

Example:

Features:

-timer on the game and will submit after 2 minutes
-pop-up showing score after submit button is clicked

Issues:

-added a form radio button, but all were clicking. Added a name="" to make only one in a set clickable.
-tried to change the css of the radio buttons but couldn't figure it out
-made a bunch of commits to the wrong repo
-Would like to make more css features time permitting
