# Title: Trivia Game

This project will utilize **html, css, javascript** to create a _self-scoring_ trivia game about random music trivia

    HTML: list of questions, radio button for each answer.
    JAVASCRIPT: correct answers add to the score, submit button will automatically show score, timeout function at onload to automatically submit the quiz if timer runs out, timer function to restart the game after it ends.
    CSS: colorful game page


    optional functions:
    event listeners: onclick, on last button click - show score, have image pop up
    end game function

The completed trivia game can be played here: https://afkelly14.github.io/Project-4/

# Features:

-self scoring
-timer on the game and will submit after 2 minutes
-pop-up showing score after submit button is clicked

# Issues:

-added a form radio button, but all were clicking. Added a name="" to make only answer in a set clickable.
-tried to change the css of the radio buttons but proved difficult. May go back after to update it.
-made a bunch of commits to the wrong repo
-Would like to make more css features time permitting
-added a restart game button to the score box but button not showing up. Added a timer to restart game instead.
